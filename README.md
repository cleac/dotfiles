# .files

Those are dotfiles that I use

_Disclaimer : I take no responsibility on this working at yout machine_

## What are those?

Those are configs that help me live better. Here they are listed:

### .tmux.conf

Configuration for tmux.

#### How to use?

Place it at your home directory, or make a symlink there, like this `ln -s <where-repo-is>/.tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf`

### .vimrc

A configuration for vim I use. 

_Note_: I use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) as a plugin manager. Install it, if you want to use it

#### How to use?

The same, as .tmux.conf

### awesome

This is a config for awesome window manager. Mostly, edited default configuration, but I added some little things from myself.
For it to correctly, `kmix`, `xscreensaver`, `konsole`, `krusader` and awesome `vicious` plugins are required.

Also, it uses this: https://github.com/plotnikovanton/net_widgets (it is included in repo).

#### How to use?

Place it at `~/.config`
